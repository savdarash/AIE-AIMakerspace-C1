In fiscal year 2023, we increased the\\npercentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers\\ncomprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is\\nimportant in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for\\nmany workloads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by\\nour continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including\\nthe top supercomputer, on the Green500 list.\\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers\\nto do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year\\n2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were engaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales,\\nmarketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\\nrelating to human capital management.\\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives,\\nscientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\\nRecruitment\\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent\\nto NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership\\ntalent. Our workforce is 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in\\nglobal female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee\\nreferrals.\\nDevelopment and Retention\\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer\\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums.\\nWe create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to\\nthe most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.\\nWe implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented\\nspecifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread\\nreadiness for future advancement.\\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain\\ninsight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive\\ntool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall\\nturnover rate was 2.7%.\\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except\\nwhere unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their\\ninterests with those of our shareholders.\\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k)\\nprograms in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off\\npolicies to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges.

If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of\\nnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and\\nhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\\nsupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\\nother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability\\nto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may\\nnot be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market\\nshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability\\nissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to\\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our\\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility\\nin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies,\\nsuch as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our\\nproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper\\nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have\"], ground_truth='Factors that contribute to challenges in estimating demand and supply constraints include: the complexity of technological transitions, unanticipated quality or production issues, customer purchasing decisions made by downstream parties, underestimating or overestimating customer demand, cancellation or deferral of orders, competition from competitors, changes in average selling prices, inventory write-downs and impairments, non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, changes in technology and use cases, and geopolitical tensions.', evolution_type='simple')"

These restrictions can limit the ability to serve demand abroad, impact manufacturing and warehousing locations, and create a competitive disadvantage. The focus of export control restrictions includes semiconductors associated with AI, such as GPUs. The United States has imposed unilateral controls, and additional controls are likely to be adopted. These controls can be broad in scope and application, and may restrict exports to certain markets, including China. The restrictions can disrupt the supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting the ability to serve demand in markets outside China. The possibility of additional export controls has also negatively impacted demand for AI-related products. Compliance burdens and changes in export control rules can further impact the business. The impact of export control restrictions extends to the ability of research and development teams to execute objectives, and can provoke responses from foreign governments. Regulators in China have inquired about sales and fulfillment commitments, which could result in penalties or restrictions. The USG has announced export restrictions and licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries, impacting exports of certain chips and related technology. Licensing requirements also apply to future NVIDIA integrated circuits and certain networking products destined for China. New and updated licensing requirements have been announced for exports to China and certain countries, impacting products exceeding performance thresholds.\",\n          \"NVIDIA Corporation recognizes revenue from license and development arrangements with customers by treating them as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. Progress to completion is measured based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, a provision for such loss is recorded.\",\n          \"Export controls negatively impact NVIDIA's business by restricting their ability to export their products to certain markets, including China. These controls impose licensing requirements on certain chips, software, hardware, equipment, and technology used in the development, production, and manufacturing of chips.

These risks may increase as we shorten our\\nproduct development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\\ncomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available\\nfrom third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply\\nor capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead\\ntimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and\\nmay continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity,\\nwhich may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,\\nor otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\\n•\\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\\n•\\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n•\\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n•\\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n•\\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n•\\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\\n•\\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n•\\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\\n•\\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\\n•\\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\\n•\\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services;\\n•\\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n•\\nthe demand for our products; or\\n•\\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to\\nenter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\\nyear 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very\\nstrong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if\\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are\\ncomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship\\nand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long\\nmanufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of\\nprior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience\\nreduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\\n16\\n',\n",

If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of\\nnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and\\nhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\\nsupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\\nother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability\\nto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may\\nnot be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market\\nshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability\\nissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to\\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our\\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility\\nin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies,\\nsuch as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our\\nproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper\\nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future\\nimpact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to\\nbe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of\\ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0\\nmerge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining.

These restrictions can limit the ability to serve demand abroad, impact manufacturing and warehousing locations, and create a competitive disadvantage. The focus of export control restrictions includes semiconductors associated with AI, such as GPUs. The United States has imposed unilateral controls, and additional controls are likely to be adopted. These controls can be broad in scope and application, and may restrict exports to certain markets, including China. The restrictions can disrupt the supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting the ability to serve demand in markets outside China. The possibility of additional export controls has also negatively impacted demand for AI-related products. Compliance burdens and changes in export control rules can further impact the business. The impact of export control restrictions extends to the ability of research and development teams to execute objectives, and can provoke responses from foreign governments. Regulators in China have inquired about sales and fulfillment commitments, which could result in penalties or restrictions. The USG has announced export restrictions and licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries, impacting exports of certain chips and related technology.

Regulators in China have inquired about sales and fulfillment commitments, which could result in penalties or restrictions. The USG has announced export restrictions and licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries, impacting exports of certain chips and related technology.
